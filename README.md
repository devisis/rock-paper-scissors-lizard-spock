# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

The first known mention of the game of Rock Paper Scissors was in the book 'Wuzazu'. The game dates back to the time of the Chinese Han dynasty (206 BC â€“ 220 AD). From then til now it has been adapted in different ways. This is one of those fun adaptations. My work will target those who aim to play a quick game and fans of this adaptation.
