# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

The first known mention of the game of Rock Paper Scissors was in the book 'Wuzazu'. The game dates back to the time of the Chinese Han dynasty (206 BC â€“ 220 AD). From then til now it has been adapted in different ways. This is one of those fun adaptations. My work will target those who aim to play a quick game with the element of chance and fans of the rock paper scissors lizard spock adaptation.

## UX

I have chosen to impliment a dark but vibrant design which imitates an arcade screen. The arcade image used in the background goes hand in hand with the tones of the styling and the glow of the borders to give the game a fun retro feel. I feel that in choosing these options I have a greater chance of grasping the users attention and retaining their interest.

## Exernal User Goal

The site user wants to play an online game that has the element of chance.

## User Stories

- As a user I should be able to understand the difference between each set option.
- As a user I should be able to find out how to play.
- As a user I should be abe to reset the game.
- As a user I should be able to choose the amount of game I want to play to.
- As a user I should be able to distinguise between rock, paper, scissors, lizard and spock.
- As a user I should be able to track my score.

## Site Owner Goal

The site goal is to provide a game to entertain online users.

### Colour Scheme

With the colour scheme I picked two colours that I felt complimented each other well on coolers.co/. I also inspected the colors in my background image and selected a few that would blend in. I feel the neon orange partnered with the glow carrys forward the feeling that the user in an arcade.

### Typography

- I chose a Google font that I felt wasnt too professional and went along with the fun attention grasping theme I had in mind. The text is clear and easy to read and gives the buttons a smooth look.

font-awesome - used the icons from font awesome for the rock, paper, scissors, lizard, and spock options as they were easy to identify.
